The OpenShift PaaS is moving rapidly towards supporting and managing applications on a wide range of middleware including application servers, business logic/rules engines, service delivery frameworks, data grids, messaging systems, continuous integration systems, and application management systems. These types of applications have been rare in existing PaaS implementations. Equally rare is the ability to run these types of applications in both public and private clouds.
This session will demonstrate the deployment, configuration, and management of middleware-based applications to a PaaS using the following open source projects and the latest in cartridge development.

OpenShift Origin – Public/Private PaaS (https://plus.google.com/communities/114361859072744017486, http://github.com/openshift)

JBoss Application Server 7 – JEE application server (http://www.jboss.org/jbossas)

JBoss Infinispan – Data Grid (http://www.jboss.org/infinispan)

ActiveMQ – Messaging (http://activemq.apache.org)

JBoss RHQ – Application Management (http://www.jboss.org/rhq)"
